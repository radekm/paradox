\begin{abstract}
None of the famous theorem provers for first-order logic deal with
many-sorted problems. Ideally, we would like our provers to understand
many-sorted logic, but in the meantime, we want to be able to
\emph{translate} a sorted problem into an unsorted one so that the
existing theorem provers and model finders can solve it for us.
%There are two natural ways to do this. One is a) easy, b) efficient

%and c) unsound, while the other is a) always correct and b) often wasteful. 
There are two natural ways to do this translation. One is easy and efficient
but unsound, while the other is always correct but often wasteful. 
We present a technique called
\emph{monotonicity inference} that allows us to use a mixture of the
two techniques: the efficient one when sound and the wasteful one when
necessary. We apply this technique in a new tool, Monopoly, which
automatically translates from sorted to unsorted first-order logic.
