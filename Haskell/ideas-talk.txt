the whole Equinox algorithm

- built-in equality
- no remembering of substitutions

in particular:
  - how the partial model is extended
  - how the substitutions are found
  - correctness proof
  - "layered soundness" -- nice!

extensions:
  - constructor functions
  - function definitions
  - transitive closure
  - induction (?)

mention:
  - clause splitting
  - clausification, arity
  - parallel clauses

ideas:
  - structural rules (example of shifting which layer is responsible)

problems:
  - too many instances (balance)
  - waiting for all instances before SAT is called
  
removed from "lagoms":
  - unit equality
  - extremely large problems (fact sets)

step(true) = true

(A = true => step(A) = true) => A = true

step(A) = true => A = true
